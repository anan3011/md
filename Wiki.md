The Fault in Our Stars is a novel by [John Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Green). It is his fourth solo novel, and sixth novel overall. It was published on January 10, 2012. The title is inspired by Act 1, Scene 2 of [Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare)'s play [Julius Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar_(play)), in which the nobleman [Cassius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Cassius_Longinus) says to [Brutus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Junius_Brutus_the_Younger): "Men at some time were masters of their fates, / The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, / But in ourselves, that we are underlings." The story is narrated by Hazel Grace Lancaster, a 16-year-old girl with thyroid cancer that has affected her lungs. Hazel is forced by her parents to attend a [support group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_group) where she subsequently meets and falls in love with 17-year-old Augustus Waters, an ex-basketball player, amputee, and survivor of [osteosarcoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteosarcoma).
